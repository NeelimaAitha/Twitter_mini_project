"I went to see the Nun. I walked out of it. Terrible film, sooo predictable, boring overused jump scares, “oh theres a creepy figure... I’ll go follow it” crap. If you’ve seen any horror movie ever you’ve already seen this. Its all about money now rather than making true horror."

Sierra burgess was a horrible movie. The message they tried to present didn’t work at all and it just blew up into a shit show. Sierra herself was a horrible person and the “jokes” that were made were not funny they were offensive to so many people. I cant support this movie.

This was a list of movies from Illumination back in 2012. Every single one of them is either cancelled or was/is being made at another studio. Such a shame that most of these didn't get off the ground because I'd actually watch some of them.
